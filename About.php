    <li>What features have you done or attempted in creating the site we should know about?
    <br>== I have added a simple javascript, script where if an error occurs a pop up box would appear.
    <br>== I have also added a search bar in the homepage to enable quick status searching.
    <br>== The Menu is also fixed so it can be accessed from any page.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Which parts did you have trouble with?
    <br>== I mostly had trouble with validating the form, to ensure user inputs were valid or invalid.</li>
        <br>
    <li>What would you like to do better next time?
    <br>== I would like to understand php and database connection better next time as well as precise form validation.</li>
        <br>
    <li>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?
    <br>==<a href="www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a>
    <br>==<a href="php.net/manual/">PHP Manual</a>
    <br>== Lecture Slides</li>
        <br>
    <li>What have you learnt along the way?
